## PHPAccessControl - What is this?
A basic PHP Access Control for your website/pages - Session based. This is a basic 
implementation, where you can add pages to Access Control, and later verify the required
session value for access. <br/> <br/>
The general-purpose scenario for this version is that you create a Session value/var that
is not empty and assign it for a page. <br/> <br/>
Example, you have a Admin dashboard panel, that you only want to be accessible if Session
value "adminUser" is set.

## How to use it?
PHPAccessControl is a basic Session based approach to verify if the current user has the correct
privileges set to access the page; 
<br/><br/>
You can add restricted pages that require Access Control, and then later on verify if the required
session variable is set to allow access. Check config file for example.
